# Research-Code

This repo includes work for multiple classical novae detailed below


## Lightcurves for:

##### V1535 Sco - ( V1535Sco_work )
##### V407 Cyg - ( V407_work )
##### V5589 Sgr - ( V5589_work )
##### V392 Per - ( V392Per_work )
##### V723 Cas - ( V723Cas_work )
##### V1534 Sco - ( V1534Sco_Work )
##### RS Oph - ( RS Oph Work )
##### U Sco - ( USco Lightcurve )


## Brightness Temperature for:

##### V1535 Sco - ( V1535Sco_Brightness_Temp )
##### V407 Cyg - ( V407Cyg_Brightness_Temp )
##### V5589 Sgr - ( V5589Sgr_Brightness_Temp )
##### V392 Per - ( V392Per_Brightness_Temp )
##### V723 Cas - ( V723Cas_Brightness_Temp )
##### V1534 Sco - ( V1534Sco_Brightness_Temp )
##### RS Oph - ( RS_Oph_Brightnesss_temp )
##### U Sco - ( U Sco Brightness Temp )


## Brightness Temperature combination notebook:
##### Combined_Brightness_Temperature
###### ( This has all novae, V1535 Sco, V1534 Sco, V407 Cyg, V5589 Sgr, V392 Per, V723 Cas, RS Oph, and USco. The notebook conatins code and a plot which compiles and compares the novae at the most constraining frequency (which is usually the smallest frequency), and the frequency for each nova can be seen through the code. )


## Vpeak vs Smax and Tmax vs visual t2 plots
##### Vpeak vs Smax and tmax vs visual t2
###### ( This has all the novae, V1535 Sco, V1534 Sco, V407 Cyg, V5589, V392 Per, V723 Cas, RS Oph, and U Sco. This plots optical features from the novae with radio features, specifically it plots the Vpeak (The optical peak's apparent magnitude) vs the Smax (The radio's highest flux), and Tmax (The day when the radio hits the max flux) vs t2 (The time it takes for the optical to fall by two magnitude). )


## Spectral Index Plots for:

##### V1535 Sco - ( V1535Sco_Spectral_Index )
##### V407 Cyg - ( V407_Spectral_Index )
##### V5589 Sgr - ( V5589_Spectral_Index )
##### V392 Per - ( V392Per_Spectral_Index )
##### RS Oph - ( RS Oph Spectral Index )
##### V1534 Sco - ( V1534 Sco Spectral Index )
##### U Sco - ( USco Spectral Index )
###### (No V723 Cas isn't missing, it doesn't have enough data to plot brightness temperature.)
